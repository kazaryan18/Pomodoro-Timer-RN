Tomato.io

To run the project create a react project and replace the pre created App.js file with the one linked. There will 
also be another link with a file called tomato.png, create a folder named images in the app and place thhe tomato.png
file inside the folder.

Once the app starts the countdown will immediately start from 25 minutes. Clicking the stop button will stop the countdown,
after which the user may change the time for the countdown and the time for the break. This should live update the timer
and clicking start will then start the timer from the user inputted time. Once the timer hits 0, the phone will vibrate
and it will start the countdown for the break timer. This will go on in an infinite loop. Clicking reset sets the timer to
its default position of 25 minutes and a break time of 5 minutes. When reset is clicked the timer should now count down
until the user clicks start.
